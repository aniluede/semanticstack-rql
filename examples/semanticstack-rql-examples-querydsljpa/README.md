# The "Burger-Menu" example: QueryDSL + JPA
This is a simple setup where the RQL -> QueryDSL backend is used.
I.e. it demonstrates how to use filter, paging (limit) and sort together.

## Maven + eclipse
The maven pom.xml is prepared to setup a eclipse project with the m2e plugin probably.

## Testing
You can find the REST APi under http://localhost:8080/api/v1/menu

## Compile notes
This example is using lombok: https://projectlombok.org/ which means if you are using eclipse you must update your installation: https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse
